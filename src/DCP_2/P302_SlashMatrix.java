 * You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell consists of either /, \, or an empty space. Write an algorithm that determines into how many regions the slashes divide the space.
    For example, suppose the input for a three-by-six grid is the following:
    \    /
     \  /
      \/
    Considering the edges of the matrix as boundaries, this divides the grid into three triangles, so you should return 3.
